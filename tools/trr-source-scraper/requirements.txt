# TRR Source Scraper Dependencies

# HTTP requests
requests>=2.28.0

# HTML parsing
beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0
lxml>=4.9.0

# YAML parsing (for Atomic Red Team test files)
pyyaml>=6.0

# DuckDuckGo search (replaces fragile HTML scraping)
ddgs>=9.0

# Optional: JS-rendered page fetching (CrowdStrike, Elastic, Red Canary, etc.)
# Requires separate browser install after pip install:
#   pip install playwright
#   playwright install chromium
# The scraper works without Playwright — JS-heavy sites will show ⚠ empty
# in the checklist, prompting manual review.
