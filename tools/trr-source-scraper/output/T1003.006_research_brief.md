**Tactics:** Credential Access
**Platforms:** Windows

---

## Quick-Start Research Checklist

> **How to use this:** Work through each phase in order. Complete all
> stop-checks before advancing. Mark items `[x]` as you finish them.

### Phase 1 — Technique Overview

- [x] Official ATT&CK page fetched: [T1003.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)
- [ ] Read the description and summarize the technique in 2–3 sentences **without naming any tool**
- [x] Tactics identified: Credential Access
- [x] Platforms in scope: Windows

### Phase 2 — Technical Background

- [ ] Review the 10 Microsoft documentation source(s) found below
- [ ] Identify the Windows APIs, protocols, or OS services involved
- [ ] Understand what prerequisites the attacker must satisfy
- [ ] Document which security controls this technique bypasses or abuses
- [ ] **Stop check:** Can you explain *why* this technique works without referencing a tool?

### Phase 3 — DDM Construction

Suggested starting operations based on ATT&CK data sources:

- [ ] `[?]` (Identify essential operations from the technique description above)

For each operation, classify it:
  - `[E]` Essential — must happen for the technique to work
  - `[I]` Immutable — attacker cannot change it
  - `[O]` Observable — visible through available telemetry
- [ ] **Stop check:** No unresolved `[?]` markers remain

### Phase 4 — Emulation Tests

- [x] 2 Atomic Red Team test(s) found — see section below
- [ ] Review each test to validate your DDM covers the operations it performs

### Phase 5 — Detection & TRR Documentation

- [ ] Review 8 GitHub resource(s) and 6 Sigma rule source(s) found below
- [ ] Map each essential operation to an available telemetry source
- [ ] Identify detection gaps (essential operations with no telemetry)
- [ ] Write procedure narratives (not step lists — explain *why* each step works)
- [ ] Assemble the TRR document following the TIRED Labs template

## MITRE ATT&CK Reference

### [T1003.006 — OS Credential Dumping: DCSync](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)

> Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API)[1] [2] [3] [4] to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync. Members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, and Enterprise Admin groups or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull password data[5] from Active Directory, which may include current and h...

## Atomic Red Team Emulation Tests

Found **2 test(s)** in the Atomic Red Team repository.
Full file: [T1003.006.yaml](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1003.006/T1003.006.yaml)

### Test 1: DCSync (Active Directory)

**Platforms:** windows
**Executor:** `command_prompt`
**GUID:** `129efd28-8497-4c87-a1b0-73b9a870ca3e`

**Description:** Active Directory attack allowing retrieval of account information without accessing memory or retrieving the NTDS database. Works against a remote Windows Domain Controller using the replication protocol. Privileges required: domain admin or domain controller account (by default), or any other account with required rights. [Reference](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1729)

### Test 2: Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount

**Platforms:** windows
**Executor:** `powershell`
**GUID:** `a0bced08-3fc5-4d8b-93b7-e8344739376e`

**Description:** The following Atomic will run Get-ADReplAccount from DSInternals. Upon successful execution, domain and credentials will appear in stdout.
