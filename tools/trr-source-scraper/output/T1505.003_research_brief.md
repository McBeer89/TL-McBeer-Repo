**Report Version:** 1.1
**Technique:** [T1505.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)
**Scan Mode:** Full Enriched Run
**Tactics:** Persistence
**Platforms:** Linux, Network Devices, Windows, macOS

## Quick-Start Research Checklist

> **How to use this:** Work through each phase in order. Complete all
> stop-checks before advancing. Mark items `[x]` as you finish them.

### Phase 1 — Technique Overview

- [x] Official ATT&CK page fetched: [T1505.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)
- [ ] Read the description and summarize the technique in 2–3 sentences **without naming any tool**
- [x] Tactics identified: Persistence
- [x] Platforms in scope: Linux, Network Devices, Windows, macOS

### Phase 2 — Technical Background

- [ ] Review the 10 Microsoft documentation source(s) found below
- [ ] Identify the Windows APIs, protocols, or OS services involved
- [ ] Understand what prerequisites the attacker must satisfy
- [ ] Document which security controls this technique bypasses or abuses
- [ ] **Stop check:** Can you explain *why* this technique works without referencing a tool?

### Phase 3 — DDM Construction

Suggested starting operations based on ATT&CK data sources:

- [ ] `[?]` (Identify essential operations from the technique description above)

For each operation, classify it:
  - `[E]` Essential — must happen for the technique to work
  - `[I]` Immutable — attacker cannot change it
  - `[O]` Observable — visible through available telemetry
- [ ] **Stop check:** No unresolved `[?]` markers remain

### Phase 4 — Emulation Tests

- [x] 1 Atomic Red Team test(s) found — see section below
- [ ] Review each test to validate your DDM covers the operations it performs

### Phase 5 — Detection & TRR Documentation

- [ ] Review 10 GitHub resource(s) and 10 Sigma rule source(s) found below
- [ ] Map each essential operation to an available telemetry source
- [ ] Identify detection gaps (essential operations with no telemetry)
- [ ] Write procedure narratives (not step lists — explain *why* each step works)
- [ ] Assemble the TRR document following the TIRED Labs template

## MITRE ATT&CK Reference

### [T1505.003 — Server Software Component: Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)

> Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.[1] In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web serv...
